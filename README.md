Upon first joining the Decoded Brain Organization (DBOS) during my first semester (Fall 2025) at Pasadena City College, I challenged myself to complete a machine learning project led by Public Relations Officer, Jason Lee.
Goals of the project include learning the intuition and mathematical algorithms involved in deep learning (convolutional) neural networks, Python language, and PyTorch library implementation.
As the title mentions, this Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained to detect handwritten numbers published by MNIST. 
My reflection upon completing this project is my newfound passion and dedication to machine learning and the DBOS mission.
I would like to accredit the DBOS members for their hard work in creating such an opportunity for incoming club members like myself to learn valuable skills in a welcoming environment.
